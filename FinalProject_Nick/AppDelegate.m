 APPLICATION NOTES:
 
 -For this project an external library was used to handle MIDI functionality.
 Called 'MidiBus', from https://audeonic.com/midibus/
 The library handles the 'heavy lifting' of using the core MIDI framework, so focus can be put on the 'higher level' aspects,
 ie. actually sending & recieving MIDI
 
 -App layout works best on iPad Retina & iPhone 5s
 
 -Connection can to mac be simulated while running simulator, by enabling network session on Mac utilites > Audio MIDI setup > MIDI Studio > Network, and enable session, 'iphone simulator' should appear.
 
 -Bluetooth connectioon will only be available when running on physical iOS device (cannot simulate bluetooth)
 
 -Icons for UI were obtained from https://icons8.com/, rest of custom graphics made in Adobe Illustrator
