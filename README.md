# Controlla-iOS
DAW control surface app for iOS (iPad), made for a University 2nd year mobile applications module. Can connect to a computer running any DAW via WiFi or bluetooth and sends MIDI commands. 
TODO - Compiled for an old version of iOS (2016), will need work in order to compile for latest iOS version most likely.

# Features

The app has 3 main screens, a MIDI keyboard, a drum pad style chord trigger and a basic mixer.
At the bottom of every screen is a set of basic transport controls, and at the top some icons showing 
connectivity status (bluetooth or WiFi).
